#### Configuration

`app/config/app-config.js` contains several important variables:
 - `apiUrl`: Your JHipster app's API url
 - `appUrlScheme`: Your app's URL scheme (this is also configured for iOS (Info.plist) and Android (AndroidManifest.xml) separately.
 - `uaaBaseUrl`: (UAA only) If you use a `uaaBasePath` other than `uaa`, configure this variable
