#### Configuration

 - In `AppConfig.js`, set your JHipster app's API url
 - If you use the UAA auth type and use a uaaBasePath other than `uaa`, configure that variable
 - If you use the Oauth2 auth type and JHipster <=v4.90, set the client ID and client secret from your JHipster app's application.yml
 - If you use social login, set your client variables in AppConfig.js
