> A React Native blueprint for [JHipster](http://www.jhipster.tech) apps, complete with authentication, an entity generator, JDL support, E2E tests, and more.

**Note:** The intial version of this blueprint (v4) generates the same application as [Ignite JHipster v3](https://github.com/ruddell/ignite-jhipster/tree/2d84fb2956fc62d6dea29e07c314838689c55f67)

## Getting Started

### Requirements

-   Node v12+
    -   Verify version with `node -v`
-   [React Native CLI setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
-   [jhipster-react-native](https://github.com/ruddell/jhipster-react-native) installed
    -   Install with `npm install -g generator-jhipster-react-native`
-   Mac users require [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) to be installed
    -   Verify `pod` installation with `pod install`

Create a directory for your app:

```sh
mkdir SampleApp && cd SampleApp
```

To generate an app, run the following command:

```sh
rnhipster

# Acceptable with JHipster v7+
jhipster --blueprints react-native
```

Answer the prompts, entering the path to your JHipster app and choosing any plugins you want. The generator will create a new directory containing the project (preconfigured for both iOS and Android).

After generating, you can use the [entity generator and JDL importer](docs/generators.md).

### Configuration

`app/config/app-config.js` contains several important variables:

-   `apiUrl`: Your JHipster app's API url
-   `appUrlScheme`: Your app's URL scheme for deep-linking, this is also configured for iOS (Info.plist) and Android (AndroidManifest.xml) separately.
-   `uaaBaseUrl`: (UAA only) If you use a `uaaBasePath` other than `uaa`, configure this variable

#### Notes for Android

-   When running your JHipster backend locally for Android, make sure to run `adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080` so the app can communicate with your backend.
-   When building the Android app manually, prepend `app:` to the command (due to React Native Navigation). For example: `./gradlew app:bundleRelease`
