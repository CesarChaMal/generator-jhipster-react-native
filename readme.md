# ignite-jhipster

A React Native boilerplate for JHipster apps.

This module uses Infinite Red's [Ignite generator](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) is heavily based off of [ignite-ir-boilerplate-2016](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-ir-boilerplate-2016),
 but with a few JHipster twists.

## Getting Started
The requirements for running the generator include:
 - Node v7.7+
 - [ignite-cli](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) installed

Running the generator will create a new directory containing the project.  It installs react-native and sets up 
directories for an Android and an iOS app.   

#### Example

```js
ignite new SampleApp --boilerplate ignite-jhipster
```

Because the boilerplate is based on Ignite, we gain access to other generators and plugins.  Check out
 [Ignite's documentation](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/tree/master/docs) for more details.
